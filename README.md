# Application of gradiant_decent
This is a simple python based linear/polynomial(according to your model you can change some parameter only) regression.
I have used gradiant decent for prediction of model.
In this model one can find all stages like-
NORMALIZATION OF DATA.
DETECTING OUTLIERS.
REMOVING OUTLIERS.
COMPUTING COST FUNCTION USING GRADIANT DECENT.
CREATING MODEL.
CALCULATING SCORE OF MODEL.
At last one can visualize it by using python library.
